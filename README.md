# Hannah's MyFlix app

MyFlix is a web app that allows users to explore information regarding movies (for example movie titles, directors and genres). Users can create an account in order to search for movies based on title, director or genre and view the corresponding information, as well as storing movies in a list of favourite movies for future reference. Furthermore, users can edit their personal details in their profile or delete their account if they wish.
